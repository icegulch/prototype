**Exploring 'Nothing Gold Can Stay' by Robert Frost**

In the world of poetry, few verses are as succinct and poignant as Robert Frost's 'Nothing Gold Can Stay.' This eight-line poem captures the ephemeral beauty of nature and life itself. It opens with a striking paradox:

> _Nature's first green is gold,_

Frost's use of imagery is vivid and compelling. The line evokes the idea that the earliest leaves of a tree, when they first emerge in spring, are as precious as gold.

However, the poem's central message is about impermanence, which Frost conveys with the line:

> _But only so an hour._

Frost's choice of words, including 'hour,' emphasizes the fleeting nature of beauty and the transience of life. As the poem progresses, it paints a picture of nature's continual transformation.

It's a timeless reminder that all things beautiful are temporary. Read more about it on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_Gold_Can_Stay) and explore Frost's complete works on [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/957).
